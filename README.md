## Pokemon API

This project is designed around the PokeAPI which returns a detailed object of information about a specific Pokemon. So far, the user is able to request a number of Pokemon to be shown on the screen or search by a Pokemon name.

## Future Plans

Instead of just looking up Pokemon, I would like turn this into some sort of playable game.

## What is React Practice?
